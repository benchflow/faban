<h1><a name="Introduction"></a>The Service
and Tool Classes</h1>
<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>The
service and tools classes are simple POJO classes that are annotated.
Service annotations are generally defined in the package
com.sun.faban.harness.services and tools annotations&nbsp;are
generally
defined in
com.sun.faban.harness.tools with generic annotations defined in
com.sun.faban.harness for both services and tools. Since annotations
are not inherited when subclassed, we need to explicitly annotate the
relevant methods in subclasses. The service and tool context also needs
to be annotated as the harness will inject the variable with a real
reference to the applicable service context or tool context.</p>
<p>The
service objects are instantiated and invoked on the master, one object
per service configuration entry (in the run configuration file). One
service object controls multiple instances of the server in question on
multiple systems, if applicable. In contrast, the tool objects are
instantiated and invoked on the agent, the systems running the actual
servers under observation.</p>
<a name="The_Service_Annotations_"></a>
<h2>The Service Annotations<br>
</h2>
<p>The service annotations are defined in
com.sun.faban.harness.service, &nbsp;and com.sun.faban.harness. The
following are used for
annotating service implementations:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Context.html">@Context</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Configure.html">@Configure</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/services/GetConfig.html">@GetConfig</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Start.html">@Start</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Stop.html">@Stop</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/services/GetLogs.html">@GetLogs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/services/ClearLogs.html">@ClearLogs</a><br>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>@Context</h3>
<p>@Context is used to annotate an instance variable. The
variable has
to be of type <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/services/ServiceContext.html">com.sun.faban.harness.service.ServiceContext</a>.
Right after
the instantiation of the service, the variable will be injected with
the service context. The service context is made available to the
service right after it
gets constructed and before the method annotated with @Configure gets
called. The context is the
entry point for service implementations to interface with the Faban
harness as well as obtain information about the run. The service may
use methods in RunContext including all exec and java methods. As the
service usually runs on the master, most exec or java calls may
be remote. The service can also execute code blocks through the <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/RemoteCallable.html">RemoteCallable</a>
interface. The code block will execute on the target system. The
ServiceContext is serializable and is designed to be passed along with
the RemoteCallable so code blocks running remotely can have access to
the service information. However, only the local versions of <span style="font-family: monospace;">exec</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">java</span> are
available for such code blocks. Calls to remote versions of <span style="font-family: monospace;">exec</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">java</span> from a
remote system will result in a NullPointerException.</p>
<h3>@Configure</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Configure gets
called
after the
Faban infrastructure, including remote agents are set up. Having these
in place allows you to make remote calls to configure or set up the
services for a benchmark environment. The method implementation will
commonly
contain logic to start or restart servers or other supporting processes
to run the benchmark, preparing and reloading data required to run the
benchmark, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>@GetConfig</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @GetConfig is called to transfer the
service configuration files to the run output directory.</p>
<h3>@Start<br>
</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Start is called to start the
server.</p>
<h3>@Stop</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Stop is called sometime after
the
start
method
terminates. The implementation of the end method must wait for the
driver processes to terminate before proceeding. <br>
</p>
<h3>@GetLogs</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @GetLogs is
called for
trasferring server-specific logs from all the machines in the rig to
the Faban master. These logs may be server logs in general or any
specific logs of interest. For example, we'd not be interested in the
access logs on web servers as they grow pretty large. Only error logs
are needed in such cases.</p>
<h3>@ClearLogs</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @ClearLogs is called for
clearing the server-specific log files, thus preparing the system for
the next run.<br>
</p>
<a name="The_Tools_Annotations_"></a>
<h2>The Tools
Annotations<br>
</h2>
<p>The tool annotations are defined in
com.sun.faban.harness.tools, except for @Context, which is defined in
com.sun.faban.harness. Tools classes use the following annotations:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Context.html">@Context</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Configure.html">@Configure</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Start.html">@Start</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Stop.html">@Stop</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/tools/Postprocess.html">@Postprocess</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>@Context</h3>
<p>@Context is used to annotate an instance variable. The
variable has
to be of type <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/tools/ToolContext.html">com.sun.faban.harness.tools.ToolContext</a>.
Right after
the instantiation of the tool, the variable will be injected with
the tool context.&nbsp;The tool context is made available to the
tool right after it
gets constructed and before the method annotated with @Configure gets
called. The context is the entry point for tool
implementations to interface with the Faban harness and obtain relevant
information about the run, and about the service the tool is observing.
For instance, a MySQL tool needs to know the configuration of the MySQL
instance it is monitoring.&nbsp;For execution and Java calls, tool
implementations may use the convenient <span style="font-family: monospace;">exec</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">java</span>
methods provided by the ToolContext. They may as well use the static
versions provided by RunContext. Only the local exec and java calls are
available to tools.&nbsp;Calls to remote versions of <span style="font-family: monospace;">exec</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">java</span> from a
tool - which is already running on an agent system - will result in a
NullPointerException.</p>
<h3>@Configure</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Configure is the one that gets
called
after the
Faban infrastructure, including remote agents are set up. Having these
in place allows you to make remote calls to configure or set up the
tools for a benchmark environment. <br>
</p>
<h3>@Start<br>
</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Start is called to start the
tool.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>@Stop</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Stop is called to stop the tool.</p>
<h3>@Postprocess</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Postprocess is
called&nbsp;after all
tools have stopped but before the results are transferred to the
master, allowing it to post-process tool output on the systems the
measurements were taken. Not all tools need this annotation - only when
post-processing tool output is desired.</p>
