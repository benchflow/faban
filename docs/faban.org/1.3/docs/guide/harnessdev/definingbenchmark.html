<h1><a name="Introduction"></a>The Benchmark
Class<br>
</h1>
<p>The benchmark class, also referred to as a "harness hook" is
the
actual program or script that defines the process of executing the
benchmark. Every benchmark deployment requires a benchmark class .
However, if your benchmark is written using the Faban harness, the
class com.sun.faban.harness.DefaultFabanBenchmark2 will be your default
harness hook and the benchmark class is optional.
DefaultFabanBenchmark2
defines the process of how to run a benchmark written
using the Faban driver framework. A benchmark class is annotated using
annotations. They are defined in the package com.sun.faban.harness.
Since annotations
are not inherited when subclassed, we need to explicitly annotate the
relevant methods if you extend DefaultFabanBenchmark2.</p>
<p>Your own benchmark class is only required if you are using a
non-Faban
benchmark or if you want to customize and control the behaviour of a
Faban benchmark that is different from the default. The sample web101
benchmark includes a hook in <span style="font-style: italic;">src/samples/web1/harness/WebBenchmark.java</span>.
The hook is a java class that extends <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/DefaultFabanBenchmark2.html">com.sun.faban.harness.DefaultFabanBenchmark2</a>
and adds annotated methods to configure and post process the benchmark
run. You can customize, configure or subclass the other annotated
methods to include any additional tasks
that need to be done prior to or after these operations. For example,
if the benchmark requires that some script be executed (say to clean
out some files) before the start of a run, the start() method can be
modified to execute the script before calling super.start(). This can
also be done in the method annotated with @Configure (see the next
section).</p>
<p>The benchmark class can be created in the package of your
choice and must be placed into the Java source tree of your project.
The provided build script will pick up all classes in the source tree
and compile and package them properly for deploying into the Faban
harness.</p>
<a name="The_Benchmark_Annotations_"></a>
<h2>The Benchmark Annotations</h2>
<p>The
benchmark class is implemented as a plain old Java object
(Pojo) with annotated methods and referenced in the benchmark
deployment descriptor <span style="font-style: italic;">benchmark.xml</span>
explained later under <a href="deploybenchmark.html">Benchmark
Deployment</a>. The benchmark annotations used for the benchmark
class
are defined in
<a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/package-summary.html">com.sun.faban.harness</a>.
The followings are the annotations used:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Validate.html">@Validate</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/Configure.html">@Configure</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/PreRun.html">@PreRun</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/StartRun.html">@StartRun</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/EndRun.html">@EndRun</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/PostRun.html">@PostRun</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/KillRun.html">@KillRun</a><br>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>@Validate</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Validate is called for validating
the
benchmark
configuration file. It is the first method called when the benchmark
starts after initialization of the benchmark class. No other
facility or remote Faban agents are started before or while the
validate method is in progress. The validate method is used to validate
the benchmark configuration to ensure that it is not only syntactically
valid (done by the xml parser) but also semantically valid. It also the
only place you may, edit, change, or complete the configuration file.</p>
<p>For integrations of existing benchmarks or workloads, it is a
common
practice to use XSL
stylesheets to translate the configuration file into the target
benchmark's configuration file. Thus it makes sense to translate the
configuration files in the validate method and this is
also a way to ensure the configuration file is correct. Such code can
be found in the <a href="http://www.spec.org/web2005">SPECWeb2005
integration example</a> provided in the samples directory of the
Faban
kit.<br>
</p>
<h3>@Configure</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @Configure is the one that gets
called
after the
Faban infrastructure, including remote agents are set up. Having these
in place allows you to make remote calls to configure or set up the
benchmarking environment. This method is however called before the
services, if any are started. The method implementation will commonly
contain logic to prepare and reconfigure remote servers or other
supporting processes
to run the benchmark. For benchmarks written using the Faban driver
framework, you may want to subclass the DefaultFabanBenchmark2 and
provide a method with this annotation to prepare your rig.</p>
<h3>@PreRun</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @PreRun is called just before
starting the
run. The method implementation will commonly contain calls to prepare
and reload data required to run the
benchmark, etc. Those functions will need all the services to be up and
available. Off-line data reload may be better done in configure.
&nbsp;For benchmarks written using the Faban driver
framework, you may want to subclass the DefaultFabanBenchmark2 and
provide a method with this annotation.</p>
<h3>@StartRun<br>
</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @StartRun actually starts the
benchmark
driver. You
will need
to ensure all the driver processes on all driver systems get started,
and - if feasible - enter the rampup state before returning from this
method as the tools timer will get started immediately after this
method terminates.</p>
<p>Generally, benchmarks written using the Faban driver framework
will
not need to override this method. However, in rare circumstances - such
as
starting processes not controlled by the driver framework, i.e.
emulators, - you'll want to override this method. Just make sure you
make a call to super.start().</p>
<h3>@EndRun</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @EndRun is called sometime after the
start
method
terminates. The implementation of the end method must wait for the
driver processes to terminate before proceeding. <br>
</p>
<h3>@PostRun</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @PostRun is called after
the end method.
This may do some
post-processing of the benchmark and/or tools results.&nbsp;For
benchmarks written using the Faban driver
framework, you may want to subclass the DefaultFabanBenchmark2 and
provide a method with this annotation.</p>
<h3>@KillRun</h3>
<p>The method annotated with @KillRun is used by the Faban
harness to
signal premature
termination of the benchmark. It provides the opportunity to cleanup
after the benchmark run. Most commonly, the kill method is left empty.
Processes started by Faban's execution facilities are automatically
terminated, except for daemons or other server processes over which
Faban does not have control. Such processes may require explicit
termination calls.
</p>
<h2>Common Facilities</h2>
<h3>The RunContext</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/RunContext.html">RunContext
</a>is the central point for getting information
about
the run. All methods in RunContext are static. We suggest a static
import of all methods in this class:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">import
static
com.sun.faban.harness.RunContext.*;</span><br>
</div>
<p>Then you'll be able to call the RunContext without referring
to the
RunContext class, which looks just like function calls. You can use the
RunContext to obtain information about the benchmark run as well as
executing commands on local or remote agents.</p>
<h3>The ParamRepository</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/ParamRepository.html">ParamRepository</a>
represents the XML configuration file and
allows
obtaining configuration parameters using an XPath pointing to the
parameter. It also allows manipulating and modifying the configuration
file (effective only in the validate method) and saving it back to the
run using the setParameter and save methods. To obtain the
ParamRepository, just call <span style="font-family: monospace;">getParamRepository()</span>.
This is a method of the RunContext. With the static import above, the
benchmark class can refer to this method without providing a reference
to the RunContext class.</p>
<p>The ParamRepository provides several
methods to access the XML structure within it. Most accesses require an
XPath string to locate the parameter. It also provides methods that
automatically parse list of strings in the elements, or even parse
host:port pairs in the hostport fields frequently used for addressing
server instances. Please refer to the ParamRepostory javadocs for more
detail, and the configuration file documentation for specific fields
used by different Faban components, such as the host:port fields.</p>
<h3>Execution Facilities</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/RunContext.html">RunContext&nbsp;</a>
provides two sets of methods for execution: 1)
The
exec methods can be used to execute any operating system or shell
command. 2) The java methods are used to execute java commands
inheriting the classpaths and other java command line parameters from
the Faban environment. Both methods make use of the Faban command
infrastructure to remotely start processes and execute commands. To
construct a command, you will need to create a new Command object. The
Command object constructor takes 3 types of parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>A
String - the command string will be parsed with our best effort to
separate it into the command and arguments. The parser command parser
is sensitive to quotes and backslash escapes and will handle most
common cases. However, it is not as complete and sophisticated as a
command processing shell in the target operating system. Please be
careful.</li>
<li>A List of command and args.</li>
<li>A vararg - the first argument is the command, followed by
it's arguments.</li>
</ol>
<p>For any given command, the execution&nbsp;search path for
scripts and binaries are as follows, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Benchmark-specific, OS-specific, CPU architecture-specific</li>
<li>Benchmark-specific, OS-specific</li>
<li>Benchmark-specific</li>
<li>Faban-specific, OS-specific, CPU architecture-specific</li>
<li>Faban-specific, OS-specific</li>
<li>Faban-specific</li>
<li>PATH environment of the Faban processes</li>
</ol>
<p>Please also note that the commands may be re-mapped on an
OS-specific
command map infrastructure. If a command is mapped, the result follows
the search path above.</p>
<h3>The Command Map</h3>
<p>The
command map allows mapping commands called by the Faban harness and the
benchmark class to some OS-Specific commands. The command map file is
an XML file located at the following location:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">$FABAN_HOME/config/&lt;OS&gt;/cmdmap.xml</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>The
following is an example command map file we use for Solaris. It resides
in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">$FABAN_HOME/config/SunOS/cmdmap.xml</span>
directory:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;?xml
version="1.0"
encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
&lt;!-- The command map file allows commands to run with a <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;specific path and specific prefix and
releaves users<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from specifying all the detail. These
commands are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;used by Faban or user commands or tools
specified by<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the user.<br>
&nbsp;--&gt;<br>
&lt;commands&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;name&gt;rsh&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;exec&gt;/usr/bin/rsh -n&lt;/exec&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;name&gt;date&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;prefix&gt;fastsu&lt;/prefix&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;name&gt;cpustat&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;prefix sequence="1"&gt;fastsu&lt;/prefix&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;prefix sequence="2"&gt;priocntl -e -c
RT&lt;/prefix&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;name&gt;corestat&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;prefix&gt;fastsu&lt;/prefix&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;name&gt;lockstat&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;exec&gt;/usr/sbin/lockstat&lt;/exec&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;prefix&gt;fastsu&lt;/prefix&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;command&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;name&gt;trapstat&lt;/name&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;prefix sequence="1"&gt;fastsu&lt;/prefix&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;prefix sequence="2"&gt;priocntl -e -c
RT&lt;/prefix&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/command&gt;<br>
&lt;/commands&gt;</span></p>
<p>Following
this example, you can see that the commands issued by the Faban harness
or the benchmark class can be mapped to specific paths, can have
multiple prefixes, or can be mapped to totally different commands in
different operating systems.<br>
</p>
<h3>File Utilities</h3>
<p>In many
instances, the benchmark class needs to process files, copy files to
different systems in the rig, or get some files from those systems. The
RunContext static class provides utility methods to deal with file
processing. We'll just address a few here. Please see the javadoc pages
for a complete list.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;"><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/RunContext.html#pushFile%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29">pushFile</a>(String
file, String destHost, String destFile)</span><br>
Copies a file over to a remote host.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;"><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/RunContext.html#getFile%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29">getFile</a>(String
srcHost, String srcFile, String destFile)</span><br>
Copies a file from a remote host.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;"><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/RunContext.html#exists%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29">exists</a>(String
host, String file)</span><br>
Checks existence of the remote file.</p>
<h2>The Default Benchmark Class<br>
</h2>
<p>For benchmarks built using the Faban driver framework, Faban
provides a default benchmark class -
<a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/harness/DefaultFabanBenchmark2.html">com.sun.faban.harness.DefaultFabanBenchmark2</a>
- that understands how to
start the Faban driver framework implicitly. This class also contains
more complex load balancing mechanisms for balancing the driver agents
among the driver and client systems. DefaultFabanBenchmark2 deprecates
DefaultFabanBenchmark which is interface-based and used in earlier
versions of Faban. It is maintained for backward compatibility only.<br>
</p>
<p>Many complex benchmarks using the Faban driver framework would
want to extend the DefaultFabanBenchmark2 to provide server control
such
as starting/stopping the web server and database server, clearing
temporary directories on the server, and even collect server
configuration information. To do so, just provide your own benchmark
class extending the DefaultFabanBenchmark2 and implementing/overriding
the relevant
methods. The most common method to implement is configure(). The
postRun() method handles some further
processing after the benchmark run is stopped.<br>
</p>
<p>One general guideline for overriding the methods is to always
call the superclass' method from inside in order not to loose any
functionality provided by the DefaultFabanBenchmark2. In addition note
that, since annotations are not inherrited, you need to explicitly call
annotation for the methods.
