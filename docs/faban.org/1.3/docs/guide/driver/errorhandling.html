<h1>Error Handling</h1>
<p class="Textbody">Exceptions
thrown at construction of the driver are considered severe/fatal. If
the Faban driver framework cannot successfully construct the driver
object for each thread, the agent detecting the condition will signal
the master. The master in turn will signal all other agents to
terminate the run.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Textbody">If an operation detects a condition
where the whole
run should be aborted, it should throw a <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/FatalException.html">com.sun.faban.driver.FatalException</a>.
Once the driver framework detects a FatalException it will log a SEVERE
message with the information provided in the exception and signal the
master and all other agents to terminate the run.</p>
<p class="Textbody">If
any other exception is thrown from an operation, it will be caught and
logged by the driver framework as a WARNING. An operation throwing such
an exception is considered a failed operation. The framework will not
record throughput and response times for failed operations to the
benchmark metrics. Instead, an error count will be recorded.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Cycle_Management"></a>Cycle
Management</h2>
<p class="Textbody">If
the exception occurred before the critical section such as at data
preparation time, the driver has not yet slept waiting for the
operation launch time, the cycle is considered unused. The driver
framework will try to schedule the next operation using the end time of
the previous operation. However, if there are recurring errors and the
scheduled operation begin time has already passed, the driver framework
will base the cycle time on the last scheduled operation begin
time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Textbody">Cycle
or think times will be recorded if the cycle was actually waited for,
no matter whether the operation succeeded or failed. For failed
operations, this means that the operation failed at or after the
critical section. Exceptions at data preparation time will not have the
cycle or think time recorded as the cycle is not executed. <br>
</p>
<h2>Impact on Mixes</h2>
<p class="Textbody">Errors may have impact on stateful
mixes. An error
in an operation may cause subsequent operations in the mix to return an
error. An example is for accessing web pages, if the login page does
not succeed, subsequent pages will return an "Access Denied." Such
error conditions demand the state of the mix to be reset. Drivers with
such error conditions will want to catch the exception and reset the
mix from the catch block. This is done by calling <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#resetMix%28%29">DriverContext.resetMix()</a>.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines </h2>
<p class="Textbody">Before
returning from the operation, the driver implementation has the
opportunity to catch the exception, keep miscellaneous statistics on
these exceptions, and either re-throw or not expose the exception. Due
to these various options, we provide the following guidelines for
handling exceptions or error conditions inside operations:&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 0.5cm; list-style-type: decimal;">
<li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P36">
<p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P36">Acceptable
errors. These are errors that may cause the benchmark run to be invalid
if they occur in large enough quantities. Most benchmarks accept a
small number of miscellaneous failures. &nbsp;If the benchmark does
not
account for these errors, the driver implementation may not want to
catch these at all. Otherwise, the driver implementation will have the
opportunity to use <a href="metrics.html">miscellaneous
statistics</a>
to keep track of such errors and still re-throw the
exception.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P36">
<p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P36">Fatal
errors. Some benchmarks may not allow for error conditions at all.
Other benchmarks may not allow for certain error conditions. If these
happen, the benchmark run should terminate. In such cases, the
operation should catch the exceptions and throw a <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/FatalException.html">FatalException</a>
with
the original exception as the cause. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P36">
<p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P36">Expected
conditions. These are exceptions that are expected but might need to be
controlled. Such exceptions usually do not indicate a failure of any
component in the system under test. Moreover, a large code path may
lead to determining this error. Common examples of such conditions are
invalid state of the user or data. In such cases, the driver must catch
the exception and <span style="font-weight: bold;">not </span>re-throw
it. The transaction will be counted as a
successful transaction. The driver may want to use <a href="metrics.html">miscellaneous
statistics</a> to keep track of such conditions and make sure
they are
in
an acceptable rate. <br>
</p>
</li>
