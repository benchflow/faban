<h1>Elements of a Driver</h1>
<br>
<p>While we do not encourage writing your benchmark from
scratch, doing so is certainly simple enough. The easier method is just
to use one of the samples Faban provided by Faban as a template. This
guide should just be a reference to better understand the benchmark
class as you'll find in the samples.</p>
<p>Benchmarks are relatively simple. You only need to provide at
least one
driver class and a driver configuration file. The driver class
represents a
plain old Java object (POJO) containing annotations defining the load
model of the driver. The Faban driver framework will use this load
model to call your driver class. The followings show the steps of
developing a
benchmark.<br>
</p>
<h2>1. Driver Class</h2>
<p>While most benchmarks define only one
driver, more complex benchmarks may use multiple driver classes. The
first driver class usually contains the benchmark definition - the
@BenchmarkDefinition annotation. We also call this driver the "defining
driver." &nbsp;Other drivers need not have the @BenchmarkDefinition
annotation.<br>
</p>
<h2>2. Imports</h2>
<p>The Faban driver framework organizes the common
driver API inside a single package: com.sun.faban.driver. Since we'll
require many of the annotations and support classes in this package, it
is useful to do a wildcard import at the top of your Java class file,
as follows:</p>
<pre> import com.sun.faban.driver.*;<br><br></pre>
<h2>3.&nbsp;Benchmark Definition</h2>
<p>In the simplest case, annotate the defining driver class with
an
annotation as follows:</p>
<pre> @BenchmarkDefinition (<br> name = "Sample Web Workload 1",<br> version = "0.2",<br> drivers = "WebDriver.class" // Optional<br> )<br></pre>
<p>A benchmark is defined using the <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="T11">@BenchmarkDefinition</span>
annotation. The configuration file refers to a class with this
annotation. &nbsp;Only one class need to be annotated with the
BenchmarkDefinition annotation.The drivers attribute lists all the
other drivers you may have. It is optional to list the defining
driver as it is automatically added to the set of drivers. For a simple
benchmark with only one driver and the benchmark
definition in the driver, the <span class="T11">drivers</span>
attribute can be omitted. Please see the <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/BenchmarkDefinition.html"><span style="font-family: monospace;">@BenchmarkDefinition</span>
annotation
reference</a> for complete detail of this annotation.<br>
</p>
<h2>4. Driver Declaration</h2>
<p>While many benchmarks may have only one driver, there are more
complex
benchmarks that have multiple drivers. Each driver class needs to have
the @BenchmarkDriver annotation. From the implementation standpoint, a
driver is a user-defined class of an arbitrary name. It is a plain old
Java object (POJO) annotated as a BenchmarkDriver as follows:</p>
<pre> @BenchmarkDriver (<br> name = "WebDriver",<br> threadPerScale = 1 // Optional, defaults to 1.<br> )<br></pre>
<h2>5. Operation Declaration</h2>
<p>Operations define the logic to generate
load to the severs. All operations for a driver are defined as methods
inside the
respective driver class. The method defining each individual
operation must be be declared as <span class="T13">public
void</span>,
must not take any arguments, and must be annotated as a <span class="T13">BenchmarkOperation</span>. The following
is an example of
a valid operation declaration:</p>
<pre> @BenchmarkOperation (<br> name = "MyOperation1",<br> max90th = 2,<br> timing = Timing.AUTO<br> )<br> public void doMyOperation1() {<br> ....<br> }<br></pre>
<h2>6. Mix</h2>
<p>A mix tells the driver framework the policy or algorithm it
should use
to select operations. While the Faban driver framework may be extended
to support additional mixes over time, currently it supports four mixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/FlatMix.html">FlatMix</a>
- This mix randomly chooses the next operation to execute based on
given probability for the mix.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/MatrixMix.html">MatrixMix</a>
- This mix maintains the state of execution. It chooses the next
operation based on the current operation and a given probability ratio.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/FixedSequence.html">FixedSequence</a>
- The fixed sequence does what it says. There is no randomness. The
operations are call in sequence.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/FlatSequenceMix.html">FlatSequenceMix</a>
- This mix allows random selection of fixed sequences (as opposed to
random selection of an operation in FlatMix).</li>
</ul>
<p>The mix annotations have a class scope. You'll need to
annotate the
driver class with the mix. Only one mix type may be specified for a
certain driver or a <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DefinitionException.html">DefinitionException</a>
will be thrown on driver startup causing the benchmark run to terminate
immediately. The following example shows a matrix mix ratio and the
translation of that into the @MatrixMix annotation:</p>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(51, 255, 255);">From/To
&#8658;<br>
</th>
<th style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(51, 255, 255);">Operation1<br>
</th>
<th style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(51, 255, 255);">Operation2<br>
</th>
<th style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(51, 255, 255);">Operation3<br>
</th>
</tr>

<td style="vertical-align: top;">30<br>

<td style="vertical-align: top;">10<br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">60<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(51, 255, 255);">Operation3<br>
</th>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">45<br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">45<br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">10<br>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<pre> @MatrixMix(<br> operations = { &#8220;Operation1&#8221;, &#8220;Operation2&#8221;, &#8220;Operation3&#8221; }, <br> mix = { @Row({10, 50, 40}), <br> @Row({30, 10, 60}),<br> @Row({45, 45, 10}) },<br> deviation = 2<br> )<br></pre>
<p>Note: For stateful mixes (all mixes except FlatMix), you may
need to
reset the state if an error occurred in the operation. Please see <a href="errorhandling.html">Error Handling</a> and the <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#resetMix%28%29">DriverContext.resetMix()</a>
method for details.</p>
<br>
<h2>7. Cycle timings</h2>
<p>Cycle timings tell the driver framework the policy or
algorithm to be
used for inter-operation times. Currently, three timing characteristics
are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">NegativeExponential</span>
- Randomly selects the cycle or think
time
from a negative exponential distribution. This is the timing
characteristic that most appropriately simulates the cycle of a large
number of users such as web workloads.<br>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uniform</span>
- Randomly selects the cycle or think time from a
uniform
distribution.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FixedTime</span>
- Presets the cycle or think time. This is useful
for
simulating user operations that are driven by external factors such as
factory or production line workers.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the mix annotations, the cycle timings can have a class
or a
method scope. You can specify the cycles as an operation annotation or
a class annotation. The class level annotations covers all operations
in that driver class. The method level annotation specifies the cycle
timings for only that operation. It also overrides the class level
annotation if there is one, just for the given operation.</p>
<p>
Also it is important to note that if specified at the operation level,
these annotations specify the policy for calculating the cycle or sleep
time&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">after</span>
the invocation of
the operation. The followings example shows specifying the negative
exponential disctibution for cycle time:</p>
<pre> @NegativeExponential (<br> cycleType = CycleType.CYCLETIME,<br> cycleMin = 500,<br> cycleMean = 5000,<br> cycleDeviation = 2<br> )<br></pre>
<h2>8. Background Operations</h2>
<p>In certain circumstances, we need to simulate client
applications
interacting with the SUT and some of the interactions are not
controlled by the user but are executed regularly in the background. A
common example is a POP mail client which needs to download the new
mail every preset number of minutes. This is the basis of the
additional annotation type @Background. The following example
shows the background annotation:</p>
<pre> @Background (<br> operations = "Synchronize",<br> timings = @FixedTime (<br> cycleTime = 60000,<br> cycleDeviation = 2<br> )<br> )<br></pre>
<p>Usually, there is only one background operation type, but the
Faban
driver framework allows for more than one operation type if necessary.
The cycle, however, must be FixedTime. Please also note that while the
background operation is scheduled separate from the foreground
operations, it actually uses the same physical thread to call the
background operation. So, background operations may cause a larger
deviation of the cycle time from the targeted cycle time. Use the
background characteristics with care, and only for an exact match to
the usage scenario.</p>
<br>
<h2>9. Constructor</h2>
<p>All Java classes have constructors. Some Java
classes that chose to not implement any constructor implicitly have a
default constructor. The constructor for a driver class is responsible
for obtaining the driver context by calling DriverContext.getContext().
It is also responsible for reading the any necessary configuration
parameter required for the load and store them in instance variables.
As instance variables are not shared across instances, they do not
incur any concurrency or synchronization frequently accessing them.<br>
</p>
<h2>10. OnceBefore and OnceAfter Operations</h2>
<p>There
are two special annotations that you can add for specific one-time
tasks. These are @OnceBefore and @OnceAfter. &nbsp;An @OnceBefore
operation gets called by global thread 0 of the driver only once and
before any other driver thread gets instantiated. This will guarantee
that no operation is called while the&nbsp; @OnceBefore operation
is
running.</p>
<p>The second annotation type is @OnceAfter. The @OnceAfter
operation is called only once after the run by thread 0 after all other
threads have terminated. Note that both run on thread 0. So any state
saved by the @OnceBefore operation can be used by the @OnceAfter
operation. This functionality is frequently used for auditing purposes,
such as counting the number of records in the database before and after
the run to ensure that the benchmark run really interacted with the
database. These operations are not designed to run lengthy tasks such
as data loading.</p>
<h2>11. Operation Implementation</h2>
<p>The
operation is where you will implement the client logic for interacting
with the servers. This usually includes preparing data for submitting
to the server, invoking the server one or more times, and optionally
validating the result from the server. As the driver instance is never
concurrently accessed, the operation implementation need not be thread
safe. Just implement the client interaction with the server and the
driver framework should take care of most tasks.</p>
