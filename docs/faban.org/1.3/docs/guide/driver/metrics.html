<h1>Metrics, Data Collection, and Reporting<br>
</h1>
<p class="Textbody"><br>
The key to running any performance benchmark is - measuring
performance. In order to measure performance, timing data for each
individual operation needs to be collected, organized, and reported.
The Faban driver framework has a rich set of data collection and
reporting facilities. And the good news is - most or all of it happens
automatically.<br>
</p>
<h2>General Metrics<br>
</h2>
<p class="Textbody">Collecting and reporting of general
metrics happens
automatically. For <a href="recording.html">automatic
timing</a>, the
operation does not need to
deal with data collection at all. With <a href="recording.html">manual
timing</a>, the operation
will need to call <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#recordTime%28%29">DriverContext.recordTime()</a>
and optionally,
<a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#pauseTime%28%29">DriverContext.pauseTime()</a>.
All data collection is then done
automatically by the driver framework.</p>
<p class="Textbody">The Faban driver framework
automatically collects
the following data:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5cm;" class="P37">Count
of successful
operations</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5cm;" class="P37">Count
of failed
operations</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5cm;" class="P37">Response
times of each
operation</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5cm;" class="P37">Cycle
time of each
operation</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5cm;" class="P37">Targeted
cycle time of
each operation</li>
</ul>
<p class="Textbody">After the run, the master will
automatically
postprocess the data and generate a <a href="summary.html">summary
report</a> and a <a href="detail.xan.html">detail
report</a>. The summary report is in XML format and can be easily
read and reformatted to fit
specific reporting needs. However, Faban provides a stylesheet for
formatting the <a href="summary.xml">summary report in a
web browser</a>.
&nbsp;The detail report is in a text format compatible with FenXi,
the tool we use for analysis and graph generation. It is also extremely
readable by a human eye.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Miscellaneous_Statistics"></a>CustomMetrics</h2>
<p class="Textbody">While most of the standard data
collection and
reporting is handled by Faban, it is not uncommon for the driver to
collect additional data. The Faban driver framework provides a
mechanism to collect such
additional metrics by attaching a <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.html">CustomMetrics</a>
implementation to the DriverContext.&nbsp;This is typically done in
the driver's constructor. There are two method signatures for attaching
the custom metrics:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li> <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#attachMetrics%28com.sun.faban.driver.CustomMetrics%29">DriverContext.attachMetrics(CustomMetrics)</a><br>
Attaches the CustomMetrics titled "Miscellaneous Statistics." This is
the same as calling attachMetrics("Miscellaneous Statistics",
CustomMetrics).</li>
<li> <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#attachMetrics%28java.lang.String,%20com.sun.faban.driver.CustomMetrics%29">DriverContext.attachMetrics(String,
CustomMetrics)</a><br>
Attaches the CustomMetrics with a given title. Only one CustomMetrics
can be attached using a given title. &nbsp;Each metrics is reported
in its own table in the summary report with the title used for
attaching. The metrics are reported in the sequence they were attached.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Textbody">Each CustomMetrics can represent a
multitude of data the particular driver needs to
keep track. At reporting time, each of the line items are
reported using a CustomMetrics.Element instance.&nbsp; The results
are
then reported in the given section of the <a href="summary.xml">summary
report</a> identified by the title.</p>
<h2>CustomTableMetrics</h2>
<p class="Textbody">Besides the standard reporting format
for CustomMetrics, some workloads may need to report arbitrary tables
in the summary report. This can be achieved by
attaching&nbsp;<a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomTableMetrics.html">CustomTableMetrics</a>
with <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#attachMetrics%28java.lang.String,%20com.sun.faban.driver.CustomTableMetrics%29">DriverContext.attachMetrics(String,
CustomTableMetrics)</a>. The CustomTableMetrics is an open
interface used for collecting stats just like CustomMetrics while
enforcing the result to be a&nbsp;<a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/common/TableModel.html">TableModel</a>.
The TableModel will then be used for reporting the result table.</p>
<p class="Textbody">While
very flexible, the CustomTableMetrics has some limitation. It does not
have the ability to render a run passed or failed as the TableModel
does not have a way to express such results explicitly. It is merely
used for reporting that does not impact the pass/fail status of the
run.
</p>
<h2>Implementing CustomMetrics<br>
</h2>
<p class="Textbody">Implementing the CustomMetrics is
rather
straightforward. In Java
terms, it is done by creating a class implementing the <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.html">CustomMetrics</a>
interface. The class can have any name, be in any package, and can have
any kind of constructor. The driver will need to instantiate the
CustomMetrics at construction time.</p>
<p class="Textbody">A typical CustomMetrics implementation
will keep
the collected data in
its instance variables. The driver needs to update the data during the
run. The driver can both check the time by calling <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#getTime%28%29">DriverContext.getTime()</a>
and check whether it is in the steady state by calling <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/DriverContext.html#isTxSteadyState%28%29">DriverContext.isTxSteadyState()</a>
methods to know whether or not to record data.</p>
<p class="Textbody">The form of keeping data is not
prescribed and can
vary from individual
instance variables to arrays to collections, etc. Since a CustomMetrics
instance is attached to each driver instance, thread, and simulated
user, it needs to be aggregated at the run. The implementor will need
to implement the methods <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.html#add%28com.sun.faban.driver.CustomMetrics%29">add()</a>
and <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.html#add%28com.sun.faban.driver.CustomMetrics%29">clone()</a>
which are used for aggregation which means he/she will need to know the
characteristics of the data. Counts and times are generally added
directly, min and max values are compared and selected. Averages and
variances will need some more complex processing, accordingly.</p>
<p class="Textbody">Once all CustomMetrics instances are
aggregated,
the driver framework
will call <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.html#getResults%28%29">getResults()</a>
on the aggregated instance to obtain the final results. This method
returns an array of <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.Element.html">Element</a>s,
each describing the metric to report. At the minimum, the <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.Element.html#description">description</a>
field must not be null. This is for just reporting metrics that have
no effect on the pass or fail status of the run. If the metric has an
impact on the pass or
fail status of the run, the <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.Element.html#passed">passed</a>
field need to be set. The <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.Element.html#target">target</a>
and <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.Element.html#allowedDeviation">allowedDeviation</a>
fields are optional and are useful to report such deviations. All
fields except <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.Element.html#passed">passed</a>
are of type java.lang.String to allow for flexibility of data type and
formatting. The data will be represented in the <a href="summary.xml">summary
report </a>exactly the same way it is formatted in the string.</p>
<h2>Implementing CustomTableMetrics</h2>
<p class="Textbody">Similar to the CustomMetrics
implementation, we subclass the&nbsp;<a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomTableMetrics.html">CustomTableMetrics</a>
class and are allowed to do all kinds of data collection and keeping
the data in the in the instance. &nbsp;It also gets aggregated
similar
to CustomMetrics. The only difference is that at reporting time, it has
to produce a&nbsp;<a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/common/TableModel.html">TableModel</a>
instead of an array of CustomMetrics.Element objects. This table will
be placed in the summary report with the given title used when
attaching the CustomTableMetrics.</p>
<h2>ContentSizeStats</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/util/ContentSizeStats.html">com.sun.faban.driver.util.ContentSizeStats</a>
is a convenient
CustomMetrics implementation provided for collecting and averaging
content sizes. It is one of the simplest cases of collecting custom
metrics and is provided as part of the <a href="../../man/fhb.html">fhb</a>
facility and and some Faban
sample code. If you just want to know the average content size,
ContentSizeStats is right for you. To use it, just do the followings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Declare an instance variable to hold the reference to
ContentSizeStats.<br>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp; &nbsp; ContentSizeStats contentStats = null;</pre>
</li>
<li>In the driver constructor, just create the ContentSizeStats
as follows:<br>
<br>
<pre> ctx = DriverContext.getContext();<br> contentStats = new ContentSizeStats(ctx.getOperationCount());<br> ctx.attachMetrics(contentStats);</pre>
</li>
<li>At the end of each operation, add up the content size:<br>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (ctx.isTxSteadyState())<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contentStats.sumContentSize[ctx.getOperationId()] += contentSize;<br></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll find the content sizes for each operation reported in
the miscellaneous stats section of the summary result.
</p>
<h2>Accessing General Results</h2>
<p class="Textbody">In many cases the results need to be
calculated
based on the run
results. For instance, the percentage of cancelled purchase orders
(custom metrics) is calculated from the number of cancelled purchase
orders and the number of total purchase orders (run results).&nbsp;
So
the <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.html#getResults%28%29">getResults()</a>
method implementation will need to have a way to know the number of
purchase order transactions during steady state.</p>
<p class="Textbody">The <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/Result.html">Result</a>
class is provided for this purpose. It provides the <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/CustomMetrics.html#getResults%28%29">CustomMetrics.getResults()</a>
with access to the run results and&nbsp; metrics. It is only
available
to the getResults() method at reporting time as this gets called after
the results are established. The getResults() method may access the <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/Result.html">Result</a>
object by calling <a href="http://faban.org/1.0/docs/api/com/sun/faban/driver/Result.html#getInstance%28%29">Result.getInstance()</a>
inside the method implementation.</p>
