<h1>The Driver Framework Architecture</h1>
<p class="Textbody"><br>
The
Faban driver framework utilizes a distributed architecture allowing
distributing the driver workload to multiple machines. It uses the J2SE
RMI facilities for all remote communication. Being able to distribute
driver load across systems is important as in sophisticated workloads
the driver can become the bottleneck. <br>
</p>
<h2>Driver Framework Components<br>
</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 0.5cm;">
  <li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P5">
    <p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P5">The <span class="T3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registry</span> </span><span class="T4">registers
all the Agents so that the Master can find them and distribute the
tasks to them. The registry must run on the master machine. There is
only one instance of the registry in a benchmark configuration.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P6">
    <p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P6">The <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T3">Master</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>starts, stops and collects the
metrics for each of the
benchmark runs.
It also provides services to collect runtime metrics, do a benchmark
health check, and to cancel the benchmark run prematurely. <span class="T3">There
is only one instance of the master in a benchmark configuration and the
master must run on the same machine as the registry.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">
    <p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">The <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T3">Agent</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>is the process that actually
drives the load. It will create
threads as
instructed by the master and drive the load for the length of time or
number of iterations as instructed by the master. Each of the agent
threads simulate a single client or user to the system under test
(SUT). These threads will instantiate the developer-supplied driver,
collect metrics, and aggregate and propagate them back to the master
for final processing and reporting.</p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">
    <p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">The <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T8">Agent Thread</span>
is created by the agent to simulate a single user executing an instance
of the driver. The agent thread executes the workload and handles all
timing functions and operation selections on the driver, and collects
all the standard metrics.</p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">
    <p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">The <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T3">Driver</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>is a developer-supplied class that
describes the workload
and contains
all the logic defining how to talk to the system under test. It
provides a grouping of all conversation scenarios, each of them
provided in form of an operation. The selection of the scenarios is
descriptively specified in the driver but actually controlled by the
agent.</p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">
    <p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">The <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T8">Benchmark</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>is a grouping of one or more drivers. The benchmark result or metric is an
aggregation of the driver <span class="T2">metrics</span> and are
reported as one final metric.</p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">
    <p style="margin-left: 0cm;" class="P7">The standard <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T8">Metric</span><span class="T3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">s</span> </span>object
collects all the common statistics of a benchmark run. Faban provides an
extension mechanism which allows a developer to specify custom metrics
that may not be covered by the standard ones.</p>

<p class="P8">The following diagram shows the significant components of
the driver:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Process Architecture<br>
</h2>
<h3>Single-Process Driver</h3><p>
The single-process driver shines for it's simplicity. It can be run
using a single Java process which controls the benchmark execution from
beginning to end. The registry is not needed for the single process
driver. Both the master and agent run inside a single process visible
to the operating system. This simplicity also makes it extremely easy
to run the single-process driver in a debugging environment such as an
IDE and makes it useful for testing components of more complex drivers
in such an environment.</p>
<p class="P8">The single-process driver is started by starting the
master. If the master does not find the registry, it will assume a
single-process driver is intended. The master will start a single agent
in-process and drive the benchmark directly from this driver
process.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="P8">The
single-process driver is limited to one running driver and one agent in
the benchmark, hence single-process. If the benchmark has multiple
drivers, only one driver can be enabled in the configuration file. If
the driver configurations are not specified, the defining driver is the
default driver. The defining driver is the driver that contains the
BenchmarkDefinition annotation and is referred with the &#8220;definition&#8221;
attribute on the configuration file. <br><br>
</p>
<h3>Multi-Process Driver</h3><p>
The multi-process driver uses the full potential of the Faban driver
framework. It allows components of the benchmark to scale across
multiple processes and, typically, across multiple systems.&nbsp; The
multi-process driver requires separate starting of all the Faban driver
framework processes. </p>
<p>
To start the multi-process driver, you'll need the start the registry,
all the agents, and the master, consequently.&nbsp; The registry and
the master needs to be started on the same system. This is called the
master system. The master system may run any number of agents or may
not run any of the agents at all. In other words, the master system may
or may not drive the load by itself. The Faban harness, when used,
generally helps reduce the complexity of the registry, agents, and
master startup. and control sequences.</p>
